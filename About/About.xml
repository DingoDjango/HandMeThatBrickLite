	<description>Tweaks how Hand Me That Brick functionality is handled in RimWorld v1.0*

- Pawns perform construction-related hauling before general hauling tasks.

- Adds a toggle for construction-related hauling in the Work tab. Compatible with Fluffy's WorkTab mod.

- Fixes a bug where pawns will "deliver resources" to buildings that do not have a resource requirement (such as simple graves).

* Hand Me That Brick has been integrated into vanilla RimWorld. There is no need to download and install Hand Me That Brick to use this mod.</description>
