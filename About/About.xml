	<description>Tweaks how Hand Me That Brick functionality is handled in RimWorld v1.0*

- Haulers will haul to constructions frames and blueprints at a higher priority:
  Vanilla	- first haul everything to storage, then haul to construction.
  Modded	- first haul to construction, then haul to storage.

- Adds a toggle for Hand Me That Brick behaviour built into the Work tab. Should be compatible with popualr mods such as Fluffy's WorkTab.

- Fixes a bug where pawns will "haul resources" to buildings that do not have a resource requirement (such as simple graves).

* Hand Me That Brick has been integrated into vanilla RimWorld. There is no need to download and install Hand Me That Brick to use this mod.</description>
