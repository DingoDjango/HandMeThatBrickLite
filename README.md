Tweaks how Hand Me That Brick functionality is handled in RimWorld v1.0

![Description](https://i.imgur.com/OG6xUzd.png)
[Hand Me That Brick](https://github.com/DingoDjango/HandMeThatBrick) has been integrated into RimWorld v1.0+, but I feel it still needs some tweaks to do what mod users wanted and got from the original mod. HMTB Lite does the following:

- Haulers will haul to constructions frames and blueprints at a higher priority:
  *Vanilla	- first haul everything to storage, then haul to construction.
  *Modded	- first haul to construction, then haul to storage.

- Adds a toggle for Hand Me That Brick behaviour built into the Work tab. Compatible with popualr mods such as [Fluffy's WorkTab](https://github.com/FluffierThanThou/WorkTab).
  *[Here's how it looks in vanilla]((https://i.imgur.com/8Ooq2ya.jpg))
  *[Here's how it looks with Fluffy's mod](https://i.imgur.com/kScn6We.jpg)

- Fixes a bug where pawns will "haul resources" to buildings that do not have a resource requirement (such as simple graves).

- There is no need to download and install Hand Me That Brick to use this mod.
